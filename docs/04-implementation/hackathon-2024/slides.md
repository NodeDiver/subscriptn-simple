# Geyser Hackathon NWC – Slides Presentation (2025-07-09)

## 🟡 Slide 1: Introduction

👋 Hi, I'm Nodii!

- Active member of my local Bitcoin community, passionate about helping entrepreneurs accept ⚡ Bitcoin payments.
- Hosting BTCPayServer for 1.5 years, providing reliable infrastructure and support.
- Supported 15+ businesses, with 7 currently active projects using my hosted BTCPayServer.
 
🌟 **Challenge:** Many businesses want to accept Bitcoin, but face technical and financial barriers to entry.

## 🟢 Slide 2: The Problem & Solution

### 🔻 Problem
- BTCPayServer owners (admins) struggle to get regular contributions from their clients (shop owners/users) to cover infrastructure and service costs.
- Subscription management is manual and tedious: admins must contact each shop owner monthly to request Lightning payments for server hosting.
- This process is inefficient and feels outdated—like being a fee collector from the Middle Ages!

### 🚀 Solution: SubscriptN
- **Automate subscription payments** using Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC).
- Seamless subscription status management:
  - Restrict admin rights for unpaid shop owners, but allow view-only access.
  - Automatically restore privileges upon payment.
- Reduce admin workload and make the process modern, fair, and scalable.

## 🔵 Slide 3: Progress & Roadmap

- Built foundational subscription features and user database.
- Set up initial API endpoints (Greenfield API).
- Integrated Alby libraries for Lightning and NWC support.
- Created GitHub repository and documentation for project continuity.
- Developed admin dashboard and improved UI/UX.

### 🛠️ Next Steps & Improvements
- Finalize NWC integration for automated payments.
- Enhance subscription status checks and admin dashboard experience.
- Rigorously address security and privacy aspects.
- Conduct feedback sessions with the community (including ONG Bitcoin Chile).
- Implement community-driven enhancements and iterate based on real-world use.

## 🟠 Slide 4: Learning Journey

📚 **Main Objective:** Learning & Development

- This is my first hackathon and public presentation experience!
- SubscriptN started as a personal learning journey and practical tool for my own needs.
- Core functionality is nearly complete; a few more days are needed for full automation.
- Collaboration planned with ONG Bitcoin Chile for real-world feedback and broader impact.
- Security is a top priority: cautious, responsible growth before wider adoption.
- Project will evolve based on community feedback and practical experience.
