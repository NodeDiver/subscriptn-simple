- **Professional aesthetics**: Avoid playful elements in favor of trust and credibility
- **Consistency**: Maintain uniform styling across all pages and components
- **Performance**: Use CSS transforms for animations, avoid heavy JavaScript
- **Accessibility**: Ensure all interactive elements are keyboard accessible

### Technical Standards
- **TypeScript everywhere**: No JavaScript files in source code
- **Prisma best practices**: Use proper relations and snake_case for database fields
- **Tailwind conventions**: Utilize custom colors from config, avoid arbitrary values
- **Component reusability**: Extract common patterns into shared components
- **Git workflow**: Feature branches, conventional commits, thorough PR reviews

**Current Status**: Project is feature-complete for initial marketplace launch. Focus on polish, performance, and user feedback before v2.0 planning.
