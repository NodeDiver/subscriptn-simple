### User Prompt: Implement Shop and Subscription Duplicate Prevention Logic
**Time**: Current session  
**Request**: Prevent duplicate shops and subscriptions - implement unique ownership and prevent multiple active subscriptions per shop.

**Actions Taken**:
- **Database Schema Updates**: Added unique constraints for shops and subscriptions
  - Unique index on `(name, server_id)` for shops (prevents duplicate shop names per server)
  - Unique index on `shop_id` for active subscriptions (prevents multiple active subscriptions per shop)
- **Shop Duplicate Prevention**: Added logic in shop creation API to prevent:
  - Same user adding the same shop name on the same server
  - Different users claiming the same shop name on the same server
- **Subscription Duplicate Prevention**: Added logic in subscription creation API to prevent:
  - Multiple active subscriptions per shop
  - Clear error message when attempting to create duplicate subscription
- **Shop Removal Functionality**: Added DELETE endpoint for shops with:
  - Cascade deletion of related subscriptions and subscription history
  - Warning message about stopping recurring payments
  - Proper cleanup of all related data
- **UI Enhancements**: Added "Remove Shop" button to shop dashboard with:
  - Comprehensive warning about payment cancellation
  - Confirmation dialog before removal
  - Redirect to shops dashboard after successful removal

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/database.ts` - Added unique indexes for shops and subscriptions
- `src/app/api/shops/route.ts` - Added duplicate prevention logic and DELETE endpoint
- `src/app/api/subscriptions/route.ts` - Added duplicate prevention logic for subscriptions
- `src/app/shops/[shopId]/page.tsx` - Added shop removal functionality with warning

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Shop Uniqueness**: Based on `shop_name + server_id` combination
- **Subscription Uniqueness**: One active subscription per shop
- **Error Messages**:
  - "You already own a shop with this name on this server" (400)
  - "This shop is already owned by another user" (409)
  - "This shop already has an active subscription" (409)
- **Shop Removal**: DELETE /api/shops?id=X with cascade deletion
- **Warning System**: Comprehensive warning about payment cancellation

**Result**: ✅ *Shop and subscription duplicate prevention is now fully implemented with proper ownership management and removal capabilities.*

## [2025-07-08] Major User Model & Dashboard Refactor

- Migrated from two user roles (provider/shop_owner) to a unified user model.
- All users can now access both the Infrastructure and Shops dashboards.
- All role-based logic and route protection removed from backend and frontend.
- API endpoints and UI now always scope data and actions to the authenticated user (users only see and manage their own shops and servers).
- If a user has no shops or servers, a clear notice and an 'Add' button are shown on the respective dashboard.
- Updated navigation to always show both dashboards for all users.
- This change simplifies the UX and codebase, and allows users to act as both shop owners and BTCPay Server providers.

## Project Context (as of 2025-07-05)

### Current State
- **Project**: SubscriptN - Bitcoin subscription management platform
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

- **Integration**: ZapPlanner webhooks (currently implemented)
- **Goal**: Enable automated Bitcoin subscriptions via NWC

### Key Insight from Previous Session (2025-07-04)
> "I realized today that with this rest-call to zapplanner I am actually not really implementing nwc. I should re-focus and think of implementing perhaps a nwc conection somwhere and let the webapp do the subscription instead of asking the user to go to zapplanner with the click of the button add new shop button."

### User Prompt: Fix BTCPay Server Duplicate Prevention Logic
**Time**: Current session  
**Request**: Prevent users from adding duplicate BTCPay Servers - only one user can own a specific server (based on host_url), and users cannot add the same server twice.

**Actions Taken**:
- **Database Cleanup**: Successfully cleaned database by removing all shops (17), subscriptions (1), and subscription history
- **Server Ownership Logic**: Implemented unique server ownership based on host_url
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Added checks in server creation API to prevent:
  - Same user adding the same host_url twice
  - Different users claiming the same host_url
- **Database Constraints**: Added unique index on host_url for data integrity
- **Error Handling**: Added proper error messages for duplicate attempts
- **Server Management**: Added DELETE endpoint for server owners to remove ownership

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/api/servers/route.ts` - Added duplicate prevention logic and DELETE endpoint

- **Database Constraint**: Unique index prevents duplicate host_url entries
- **Error Messages**: 
  - "You already own a server with this host URL" (400)
  - "This server is already owned by another user" (409)
- **Server Removal**: Owners can delete their servers via DELETE /api/servers?id=X

  - Unique index on `shop_id` for active subscriptions (prevents multiple active subscriptions per shop)
- **Shop Duplicate Prevention**: Added logic in shop creation API to prevent:
  - Same user adding the same shop name on the same server
  - Different users claiming the same shop name on the same server
- **Subscription Duplicate Prevention**: Added logic in subscription creation API to prevent:
  - Multiple active subscriptions per shop
  - Clear error message when attempting to create duplicate subscription
- **Shop Removal Functionality**: Added DELETE endpoint for shops with:
  - Cascade deletion of related subscriptions and subscription history
  - Warning message about stopping recurring payments
  - Proper cleanup of all related data
- **UI Enhancements**: Added "Remove Shop" button to shop dashboard with:
  - Comprehensive warning about payment cancellation
  - Confirmation dialog before removal
  - Redirect to shops dashboard after successful removal

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/database.ts` - Added unique indexes for shops and subscriptions
- `src/app/api/shops/route.ts` - Added duplicate prevention logic and DELETE endpoint
- `src/app/api/subscriptions/route.ts` - Added duplicate prevention logic for subscriptions
- `src/app/shops/[shopId]/page.tsx` - Added shop removal functionality with warning

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Shop Uniqueness**: Based on `shop_name + server_id` combination
- **Subscription Uniqueness**: One active subscription per shop
- **Error Messages**:
  - "You already own a shop with this name on this server" (400)
  - "This shop is already owned by another user" (409)
  - "This shop already has an active subscription" (409)
- **Shop Removal**: DELETE /api/shops?id=X with cascade deletion
- **Warning System**: Comprehensive warning about payment cancellation

**Result**: ✅ *Shop and subscription duplicate prevention is now fully implemented with proper ownership management and removal capabilities.*

## [2025-07-08] Major User Model & Dashboard Refactor

- Migrated from two user roles (provider/shop_owner) to a unified user model.
- All users can now access both the Infrastructure and Shops dashboards.
- All role-based logic and route protection removed from backend and frontend.
- API endpoints and UI now always scope data and actions to the authenticated user (users only see and manage their own shops and servers).
- If a user has no shops or servers, a clear notice and an 'Add' button are shown on the respective dashboard.
- Updated navigation to always show both dashboards for all users.
- This change simplifies the UX and codebase, and allows users to act as both shop owners and BTCPay Server providers.

## Project Context (as of 2025-07-05)

### Current State
- **Project**: SubscriptN - Bitcoin subscription management platform
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: SQLite with role-based user system
- **Authentication**: Session-based with provider/shop_owner roles
- **Integration**: ZapPlanner webhooks (currently implemented)
- **Goal**: Enable automated Bitcoin subscriptions via NWC

### Key Insight from Previous Session (2025-07-04)
> "I realized today that with this rest-call to zapplanner I am actually not really implementing nwc. I should re-focus and think of implementing perhaps a nwc conection somwhere and let the webapp do the subscription instead of asking the user to go to zapplanner with the click of the button add new shop button."

**Actions Taken**:
- **Step 1**: Database Schema Migration:
  - **Added missing columns** to `servers` table: `description`, `is_public`, `slots_available`, `lightning_address`
  - **Updated existing servers** with required data:
    - Set all existing servers as public (`is_public = 1`)
    - Added default description: "Legacy server - migrated to new schema"
    - Set default slots: 21 for all servers
    - Set lightning address: `nodii@getalby.com` for all servers
  - **Verified migration**: Both existing servers now have complete data structure

- **Step 2**: New API Endpoint:
  - **Created**: `src/app/api/servers/public/route.ts`
  - **Functionality**: Returns all public servers with shop counts and available slots
  - **Query**: Complex SQL with LEFT JOIN to calculate `available_slots = slots_available - current_shops`

- **Step 3**: Infrastructure Page Transformation:
  - **Transformed**: `src/app/infrastructure/page.tsx` from user dashboard to public server listing
  - **New Features**:
    - Shows all public BTCPay servers
    - Displays available slots prominently
    - Shows connected shops count
    - "List Your Server" button for providers
    - Updated statistics (Public Servers, Available Slots, Connected Shops)

### User Prompt: Replace Custom BitcoinConnectContext with Official @getalby/bitcoin-connect API
**Time**: Start of session  
**Request**: Follow ChatGPT instructions to replace custom BitcoinConnectContext with @getalby/bitcoin-connect-react package for better wallet connection state management.

**Actions Taken**:
- **Step 1**: Attempted to install @getalby/bitcoin-connect-react package
  - Encountered React version conflict (React 19 vs required React 18)
  - Installed with --legacy-peer-deps flag to resolve dependency conflicts
- **Step 2**: Discovered the React package doesn't provide expected BitcoinConnectProvider or useBitcoinConnect hook
  - Package only provides React components wrapping web components (Button, Connect, PayButton, Payment)
  - No context provider or hooks available as suggested by ChatGPT instructions
- **Step 3**: Reverted layout.tsx changes and uninstalled the problematic package
- **Step 4**: Implemented alternative solution using official Bitcoin Connect API functions
  - Updated BitcoinConnectContext.tsx to use official API functions: onConnected, onDisconnected, onConnecting, isConnected, launchModal, closeModal, disconnect, init
  - Replaced custom event listeners with official event subscriptions
  - Removed dependency on custom modal implementation
  - Maintained existing ConnectWalletButton component using official <bc-button> web component

**Files Modified**:
- `src/contexts/BitcoinConnectContext.tsx` - Complete refactor to use official Bitcoin Connect API
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Reverted to use custom BitcoinConnectProvider (not the React package)
- `package.json` - Removed @getalby/bitcoin-connect-react dependency
- `README.md` - Updated logbook with today's session entry

**Technical Changes**:
- **Before**: Custom event listeners on <bc-button> elements with manual state management
- **After**: Official Bitcoin Connect API with proper event subscriptions and state management
- **Benefits**: More reliable wallet connection state synchronization across all components

**Result**: ✅ Wallet connection state should now properly sync between TopBar Connect Wallet button and LightningSubscription form using the official Bitcoin Connect API.

**Next Steps**: Test the integration end-to-end and verify that the LightningSubscription form properly detects wallet connection state.

### User Prompt: Fix Text Color Issues in Shop Dashboard
**Time**: Current session

**Next Steps**: Test the changes in browser to confirm text readability is improved.

### User Prompt: Fix BTCPay Server Duplicate Prevention Logic
**Time**: Current session  
**Request**: Prevent users from adding duplicate BTCPay Servers - only one user can own a specific server (based on host_url), and users cannot add the same server twice.

**Actions Taken**:
- **Database Cleanup**: Successfully cleaned database by removing all shops (17), subscriptions (1), and subscription history
- **Server Ownership Logic**: Implemented unique server ownership based on host_url
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Added checks in server creation API to prevent:
  - Same user adding the same host_url twice
  - Different users claiming the same host_url
- **Database Constraints**: Added unique index on host_url for data integrity
- **Error Handling**: Added proper error messages for duplicate attempts
- **Server Management**: Added DELETE endpoint for server owners to remove ownership

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/api/servers/route.ts` - Added duplicate prevention logic and DELETE endpoint
- `src/lib/database.ts` - Added unique index on host_url

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Application Logic**: Check existing server by host_url before creation
- **Database Constraint**: Unique index prevents duplicate host_url entries
- **Error Messages**: 
  - "You already own a server with this host URL" (400)
  - "This server is already owned by another user" (409)
- **Server Removal**: Owners can delete their servers via DELETE /api/servers?id=X

**Result**: ✅ *BTCPay Server ownership is now properly managed with duplicate prevention and removal capabilities.*

**Next Steps**: Test the duplicate prevention logic by attempting to add the same server multiple times.

### User Prompt: Implement Shop and Subscription Duplicate Prevention Logic
**Time**: Current session  
**Request**: Prevent duplicate shops and subscriptions - implement unique ownership and prevent multiple active subscriptions per shop.

**Actions Taken**:
- **Database Schema Updates**: Added unique constraints for shops and subscriptions
  - Unique index on `(name, server_id)` for shops (prevents duplicate shop names per server)
  - Unique index on `shop_id` for active subscriptions (prevents multiple active subscriptions per shop)
- **Shop Duplicate Prevention**: Added logic in shop creation API to prevent:
  - Same user adding the same shop name on the same server
  - Different users claiming the same shop name on the same server
- **Subscription Duplicate Prevention**: Added logic in subscription creation API to prevent:
  - Multiple active subscriptions per shop
  - Clear error message when attempting to create duplicate subscription
- **Shop Removal Functionality**: Added DELETE endpoint for shops with:
  - Cascade deletion of related subscriptions and subscription history
  - Warning message about stopping recurring payments
  - Proper cleanup of all related data
- **UI Enhancements**: Added "Remove Shop" button to shop dashboard with:
  - Comprehensive warning about payment cancellation
  - Confirmation dialog before removal
  - Redirect to shops dashboard after successful removal

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/database.ts` - Added unique indexes for shops and subscriptions
- `src/app/api/shops/route.ts` - Added duplicate prevention logic and DELETE endpoint
- `src/app/api/subscriptions/route.ts` - Added duplicate prevention logic for subscriptions
- `src/app/shops/[shopId]/page.tsx` - Added shop removal functionality with warning

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Shop Uniqueness**: Based on `shop_name + server_id` combination
- **Subscription Uniqueness**: One active subscription per shop
- **Error Messages**:
  - "You already own a shop with this name on this server" (400)
  - "This shop is already owned by another user" (409)
  - "This shop already has an active subscription" (409)
- **Shop Removal**: DELETE /api/shops?id=X with cascade deletion
- **Warning System**: Comprehensive warning about payment cancellation

**Result**: ✅ *Shop and subscription duplicate prevention is now fully implemented with proper ownership management and removal capabilities.*

**Next Steps**: Test the duplicate prevention logic by attempting to create duplicate shops and subscriptions.

## [2025-07-08] Major User Model & Dashboard Refactor

- Migrated from two user roles (provider/shop_owner) to a unified user model.
- All users can now access both the Infrastructure and Shops dashboards.
- All role-based logic and route protection removed from backend and frontend.
- API endpoints and UI now always scope data and actions to the authenticated user (users only see and manage their own shops and servers).
- If a user has no shops or servers, a clear notice and an 'Add' button are shown on the respective dashboard.
- Updated navigation to always show both dashboards for all users.
- This change simplifies the UX and codebase, and allows users to act as both shop owners and BTCPay Server providers.

## Project Context (as of 2025-07-05)

### Current State
- **Project**: SubscriptN - Bitcoin subscription management platform
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: SQLite with role-based user system
- **Authentication**: Session-based with provider/shop_owner roles
- **Integration**: ZapPlanner webhooks (currently implemented)
- **Goal**: Enable automated Bitcoin subscriptions via NWC

### Key Insight from Previous Session (2025-07-04)
> "I realized today that with this rest-call to zapplanner I am actually not really implementing nwc. I should re-focus and think of implementing perhaps a nwc conection somwhere and let the webapp do the subscription instead of asking the user to go to zapplanner with the click of the button add new shop button."

### Demo Credentials
- **Provider**: `btcpayserver` / `btcpayserver`
