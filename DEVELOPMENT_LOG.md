## [2025-07-08] Major User Model & Dashboard Refactor

- Migrated from two user roles (provider/shop_owner) to a unified user model.
- All users can now access both the Infrastructure and Shops dashboards.
- All role-based logic and route protection removed from backend and frontend.
- API endpoints and UI now always scope data and actions to the authenticated user (users only see and manage their own shops and servers).
- If a user has no shops or servers, a clear notice and an 'Add' button are shown on the respective dashboard.
- Updated navigation to always show both dashboards for all users.
- This change simplifies the UX and codebase, and allows users to act as both shop owners and BTCPay Server providers.

## Project Context (as of 2025-07-05)

### Current State
- **Project**: SubscriptN - Bitcoin subscription management platform
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Database**: SQLite with role-based user system
- **Authentication**: Session-based with provider/shop_owner roles
- **Integration**: ZapPlanner webhooks (currently implemented)
- **Goal**: Enable automated Bitcoin subscriptions via NWC

### Key Insight from Previous Session (2025-07-04)
> "I realized today that with this rest-call to zapplanner I am actually not really implementing nwc. I should re-focus and think of implementing perhaps a nwc conection somwhere and let the webapp do the subscription instead of asking the user to go to zapplanner with the click of the button add new shop button."

### Demo Credentials
- **Provider**: `btcpayserver` / `btcpayserver`
- **Shop Owner**: `shopowner` / `shopowner`

### Completed Features
- ✅ Authentication system with role-based access
- ✅ Database structure (users, servers, shops, subscriptions)
- ✅ API routes for all CRUD operations
- ✅ UI dashboards for both user roles
- ✅ ZapPlanner webhook integration
- ✅ Security audit and validation

### Pending Work
- 🔄 Polish half-implemented features
- 🔄 Finalize UI flows
- 🔄 Validate end-to-end subscription functionality
- 🔄 Consider NWC integration to replace ZapPlanner dependency 

### User Prompt: Refactor Implementation to Use @getalby/lightning-tools
**Time**: Phase 3 refactoring  
**Request**: Refactor our Lightning implementation to use the established @getalby/lightning-tools library instead of mock implementation

**Action Taken**: 
- **Step 1**: Confirmed @getalby/lightning-tools v5.2.0 is already installed
- **Step 2**: Completely refactored `LightningService` to use real Lightning integration:
  - Replaced mock payment logic with `LightningAddress` class for invoice generation
  - Implemented real WebLN payment processing using `window.webln.sendPayment()`
  - Added payment verification using `Invoice.validatePreimage()`
  - Added WebLN availability checking and balance retrieval
  - Added Lightning address info fetching capabilities
- **Step 3**: Updated `LightningSubscription` component:
  - Added WebLN availability checks before payment attempts
  - Enhanced error handling for real Lightning payment scenarios
  - Added user feedback for missing Lightning wallet extensions
- **Step 4**: Enhanced `BitcoinConnectContext`:
  - Added `isWebLNAvailable` state and context property
  - Improved WebLN integration and wallet detection
  - Better error handling for Lightning wallet requirements

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/lightning.ts` - Complete refactor to use @getalby/lightning-tools
