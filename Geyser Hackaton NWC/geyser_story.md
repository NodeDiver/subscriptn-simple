## 🚀 Bitinfrashop: Bitcoin Subscriptions for BTCPay, Powered by NWC

**Winner of the NWC Hackathon 2024 (- Tier 1 – New Projects)** 🏆🎉

### **What's the Problem?**

BTCPay Server admins want to share infrastructure costs. Shop owners want to easily pay for their spot on a shared BTCPay without hassle. Nobody wants spreadsheets and awkward DMs from the BTCPayserver admins asking, "hey, did you pay me this month?"

### **What's the Solution?**

⚡️ **Bitinfrashop** automates recurring Bitcoin subscriptions between shop owners and BTCPay Server admins powered by **Nostr Wallet Connect**. Think of it like Patreon or Stripe Subscriptions, but Bitcoin-native and Nostr-native. No fiat. No banks. No middlemen.

Admins track which shops are paying. Shops pay via NWC with a click. If they don't? They lose admin rights automatically via the BTCPay Greenfield API. Simple.

### **What's Working Right Now?**

✅ BTCPay Admins can:

*   Add their servers
    
*   See shops using their servers
    
*   Monitor who's paying, who's overdue
    
*   Automatically manage user roles based on payments
    

✅ Shop Owners can:

*   View all their shops
    
*   Subscribe to a BTCPay server with a slick NWC flow (thanks ZapPlanner)
    
*   See payment history and status
    
*   Cancel if they want to leave
    

✅ **Working Lightning payment flow** with real NWC integration (as demonstrated in our screenshots)  
✅ **Complete subscription lifecycle** from creation to payment confirmation  
✅ **Payment history tracking** with detailed transaction records  
✅ **Enhanced UI/UX** with loading states, error handling, and success feedback  
✅ **Database optimizations** and API route improvements for Next.js 15+

### **Development Progress by Week**

**Week 1**: Project kickoff, research, and initial Next.js prototype with basic BTCPay integration  
**Week 2**: Hackathon week - intensive development sprint, Bitcoin Connect integration, and winning the NWC Hackathon  
**Week 3**: Post-hackathon improvements - fixed API route errors, enhanced Lightning payment flow, and added payment history  
**Week 4**: Technical debt cleanup, UI/UX improvements, and preparation for production deployment

### **Development Status**

🏆 **Hackathon Winner** → 🚀 **Active Development**

We're actively improving Bitinfrashop based on real-world testing and feedback. The core Lightning payment functionality is working smoothly, and we're continuously enhancing the user experience and technical foundation.

### **Why It's Fun**

We wanted to bring ✨ **recurring Lightning payments** ✨ into reality for real Bitcoiners. It's not theoretical anymore; it works. Plus, we had fun building it, and **the Geyser Hackathon team liked it enough to give us a 1st prize**!
