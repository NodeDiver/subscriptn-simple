# Bitinfrashop Project History

## 🎉 October 2025 Update: Platform Transformation

**Major milestone:** Bitinfrashop evolved from a subscription management tool into a **full Bitcoin marketplace**!

**What's New:**
- ✨ **Unified Platform**: Removed role restrictions - everyone can list services, manage shops, and discover businesses
- 🗺️ **BTCMap Integration**: Real-time discovery of Bitcoin-accepting shops worldwide with interactive map
- 🏪 **Marketplace Features**: Browse infrastructure providers and shops with filtering, search, and categories
- 🎨 **Rebranding**: New warm orange/amber design reflecting Bitcoin's energy
- 🔗 **Connection System**: Shops can find and connect with Lightning infrastructure providers
- 📱 **Enhanced UX**: Improved discovery page, better shop type labels (Online Store/Physical Shop), aligned card layouts

**Technical Improvements:**
- Database schema simplification (unified user model)
- Counter display fixes showing accurate marketplace totals
- Sticky footer patterns for consistent button alignment
- Notification system for shops seeking infrastructure providers

The platform now serves as a **discovery hub** connecting the Bitcoin ecosystem while maintaining the automated NWC payment functionality that won us the hackathon.

## 📅 September 2025 Update

Development shifted focus to emphasize the **social and marketplace aspects** of the platform rather than purely technical NWC implementation. Progress tracked at the GitHub repository. Major updates continued through October with the marketplace transformation.

## 🏆 NWC Hackathon 2024 Winner

**Bitinfrashop** (formerly SubscriptN) won **1st Prize - Tier 1 (New Projects)** at the Geyser NWC Hackathon 2024! 🎉

### The Original Vision

**Problem:** BTCPay Server admins need to share infrastructure costs with shop owners, but coordinating payments through spreadsheets and DMs is painful.

**Solution:** Automated recurring Bitcoin subscriptions between shop owners and BTCPay Server admins powered by **Nostr Wallet Connect (NWC)**. Think Patreon or Stripe Subscriptions, but Bitcoin-native and Nostr-native. No fiat, no banks, no middlemen.

### Core Features That Won

✅ **Automated Lightning Payments** via NWC integration
✅ **Subscription Lifecycle Management** from creation to payment confirmation
✅ **Payment History Tracking** with detailed transaction records
✅ **Dynamic Role Management** via BTCPay Greenfield API
✅ **Clean UI/UX** with loading states and error handling

### Hackathon Development Sprint

- **Week 1:** Project kickoff, research, and Next.js prototype with BTCPay integration
- **Week 2:** Hackathon sprint - Bitcoin Connect integration and core NWC functionality
- **Week 3:** Post-hackathon improvements - fixed API routes, enhanced payment flow
- **Week 4:** Technical debt cleanup, UI/UX improvements, production preparation

## 🎯 What Makes It Special

**Lightning-First Philosophy:** Built for Bitcoiners who believe in sovereign, recurring Lightning payments - not theoretical, but *working* today.

**Open Development:** Transparent, step-by-step building in public. Real progress, real code, real commits.

**Community-Driven:** Actively improving based on real-world testing and feedback from BTCPay admins and shop owners.

## 👥 Who It's For

- **Infrastructure Providers:** BTCPay Server admins, Lightning node operators, Bitcoin infrastructure services
- **Shop Owners:** Bitcoin-accepting merchants needing reliable infrastructure
- **Bitcoin Ecosystem:** Anyone building or supporting Lightning-powered commerce

---

## 🚀 Vision

A thriving Bitcoin marketplace where infrastructure providers and merchants connect seamlessly, powered by automated Lightning payments and global discovery through BTCMap integration.

**Because recurring sats make the world go 'round.**
**Because this helps Bitcoin adoption.**
**Because solid tools for BTCPay + Lightning + NWC benefit everyone.**
