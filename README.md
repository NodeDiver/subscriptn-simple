## ‚ùì FAQ

**What is SubscriptN and what does it do?**
SubscriptN is a Bitcoin subscription management platform that enables automated Lightning payments for recurring services. It connects BTCPay Server providers with shop owners, facilitating seamless subscription management through the Lightning network.

**Do I need a BTCPay Server to use this?**
No, you don't need your own BTCPay Server. You can browse and connect to public BTCPay servers listed on the platform. However, if you want to provide infrastructure, you'll need to set up a BTCPay Server.

**What Lightning wallets are supported?**
We support both WebLN and NWC (Nostr Wallet Connect) compatible wallets. See the [Lightning Wallet Requirements](#lightning-wallet-requirements) section for a complete list of supported wallets.

**How does the subscription payment process work?**
1. Shop owners browse available BTCPay servers
2. They connect their Lightning wallet using Bitcoin Connect
3. They create a shop and set up a subscription with recurring payments
4. Lightning payments are automatically processed through their connected wallet
5. Payment history and subscription status are tracked in real-time

**Is this production-ready for businesses?**
This is currently a development project with working Lightning payments. While the core functionality is implemented, it's recommended for testing and development purposes. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for detailed security information.
